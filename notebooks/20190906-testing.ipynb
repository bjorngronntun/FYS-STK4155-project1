Clearly, this will be a horizontal line with intercept 1.5, which is just what we are testing for. The function $\\texttt{test_predict_ols}$ again fits a line in the plane, and checks that it passes through an expected point. I had to use $\\texttt{assertAlmostEqual}$ from $\\texttt{unittests}$, as rounding error is bound to occur with matrix inversion, even in such simple cases as these."
